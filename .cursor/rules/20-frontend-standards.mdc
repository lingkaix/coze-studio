### Frontend Standards

- Build: Rspack for web apps; avoid introducing Webpack.
- Packages: Use Rollup for Node packages when building libraries.
- UI: Prefer `@coze/coze-design`; do not introduce alternative UI frameworks without justification.
- Testing: Vitest; avoid Jest/Mocha.
- Configs under `frontend/config` (eslint, stylelint, tailwind, ts-config, vitest-config).
- Monorepo managed via Rush; respect existing scripts and constraints (`frontend/rushx-config.json`).
- Disallowed libraries listed in `frontend/disallowed_3rd_libraries.json`.
