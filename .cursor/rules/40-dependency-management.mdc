### Dependency Management

- Build tools: use Rspack (web apps) and Rollup (Node packages). Avoid adding Webpack.
- Testing: use Vitest only; do not introduce Jest, Mocha, etc.
- UI: use `@coze/coze-design` for UI components.
- Prefer existing libraries and avoid duplicates; check Rush and workspace manifests before adding new deps.
