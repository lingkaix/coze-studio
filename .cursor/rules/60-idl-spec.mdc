### IDL

- Primary entry: `idl/api.thrift` with domain-specific Thrift files under subfolders (e.g., `idl/app`, `idl/conversation`, `idl/workflow`, etc.).
- Keep IDL definitions authoritative for backend APIs and cross-service contracts.
- Update corresponding application/domain layers after IDL changes and regenerate as required by local tooling.
